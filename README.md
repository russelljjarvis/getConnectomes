# Two notebooks that make API calls to get connectomes:
* [murine V1](https://github.com/russelljjarvis/getConnectomes/blob/main/MurineV1Connectome.ipynb)
The kernel might crash in this big notebook so it has been converted to a regular Python file too.

* [fly](https://github.com/russelljjarvis/getConnectomes/blob/main/DownloadFlyBrain.ipynb)

* Instantiate connectome using [Julia](https://github.com/russelljjarvis/getConnectomes/blob/main/load_allen_measured_model.jl)
